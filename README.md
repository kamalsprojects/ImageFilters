# ImageFilters

This application is currently in beta so it may have some minor issues.

An application that allows a user to upload an image and add and remove filters. 

All filters:
- Grayscale
- Blur
- Edge Detect
- Sepia
- Invert
- Sketch
- Sharpen
- Rotate
- Flip Horizontal/Vertical

You can also adjuct the brightness and contrast of the image aswell as draw on the image using a multisized brush.

I will be updating and adding new features whenever I have time.
